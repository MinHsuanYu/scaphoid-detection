# scaphoid-detection
## Introduction
We used object detection to locate scaphoid fractures, fine-tuning the YOLOv5 model to accurately detect the position of the scaphoid bone. We then used a custom model to identify the area of the fracture with a rotated detection bounding box, resulting in a more precise detection outcome.

Unfortunately, the trained model is too large to be uploaded.
